## 💡 Why I Built This  
As a student applying for tech jobs, my inbox quickly turned into a mess. Important emails drowned in newsletters, promotions, and spam. Even though spams and promotions are categorized still people get hundreds of emails daily. This tool helps in sorting those emails out and help people focus on the categories that actually matter. 
I literally lost a **PayPal interview email** because it got buried — it went to **Narnia** 🦁.  

So, I built **IntelligentBOX** to make sure that doesn’t happen to you.
